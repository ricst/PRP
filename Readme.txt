The Progressive Resource Portal (PRP) displays a number of resources that may be of value to progressives.  Many of the sites are US focused, but I am quite willing to add more international ones as I become aware of them.

Resources have been classified into Web (primarily designed for browsing), Media (TV, radio, newspapers, magazines), Organizations and sites primarily with Blog content.  In some cases a resource is classified as more than one of these.  I've used some discression in both selection of resources and organization.

HOW TO USE: Select a tab (at bottom), navigate through entries.  Tap the one that you are interested in.  It should open in a browser-like environment, similar to mobile Safari.  Surf away on the site you selected.  You may tap ONCE with TWO fingers to bring up a navigation bar on any page you visit, including the top pages (with all the resources listed).  Tap again this way to make the bar disappear.  [Try not to touch a link when you do this].  The bar may be used to go forward, backward, reload, stop, or to send email about the current page.  You may want to send mail to yourself so you can look at the link later.  To get back to the listing for Web, Media, Orgs or Bloggers, you tap the navigation bar button labeled "Main".

Why PRP?  I was finding that I tended to only visit progressive sites I had bookmarked, and infrequently navigated outside of those.  So I created a much longer list of resources that are now available on the iPhone, and I surf around as time permits, often finding people and information I never would have otherwise explored.  Perhaps this will be your experience too.  

Note: Selecting resources obviously involves some personal choice.  I have tried to include a broad spectrum, including some of the best known bloggers.  There was no attempt to include "everyone and everything".  These are resources for progressives, though not every site has a progressive viewpoint.  If you think I've missed a valuable person, site or organization, or you've discovered an error, please let me know.  [And if you really want "everything", you might start at: liberaloasis.com and world.org].
